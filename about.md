## Bio

I'm  a Postdoctoral fellow at Mila and Université de Montréal,
Canada under the supervision of Aaron Courville and Liam Paull, as
well as a Research Intern at ElementAI under supervision of Chris Pal.
My current research interests focus on the development of better
machine learning algorithms for the control and modelling of robotic
systems. I'm particularly interested in transferring policies from
simulation to real robots and in solving the problems that low-cost
robots pose. I received my Ph.D. from INRIA Bordeaux where I
was supervised by Pierre-Yves Oudeyer. I obtained my M.Sc. in
Amsterdam in the Artificial Intelligence - Cognitive Science program
and my undergrad took place at the University Leipzig in Computer
Science and Developmental Psychology.
